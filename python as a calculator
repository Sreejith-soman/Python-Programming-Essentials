Python can be used as a claculator with the help of a lottle coding and there by python can be accessed as a calculator
Numbers are the most basic type of element in pretty much any programming language. That's true in Python just like it's true everywhere else. 
so thereby writing a simple program we can make a calculator 
for adding two numbers we just code num1= A and num2= B so sum=num1+num2
so for the conversion process like miles to km or viceversa we can use py code
